# web2

Second project for personal web development

## why

I wish to develop my own webpages and am documenting the process of learning how to code some web functionalities.

## what

Since the first web project (https://github.com/WesleyJak/js-webpages), I am learning more about how to show some better web functionality. Contrasting with the first project, this one was developed without following a guide side by side (however I did still follow the same basic processes as the first project). 

## details

Web2 starts with a login page (incorporated an image, made visuals kind of nice). There is a way to register and 'create' an account (no DB yet, just instance-saved variables for the user). With an account created, user can log in, and write some type of blog post, then shown in a separate web page (no log in required to access). 

## thoughts

Look: This project I started using pico.css to make the site look a bit better and learn how to configure the look and feel myself. Its very basic but is currently suiting my needs so I think I can stick with this.

Next - Log in: I should be looking into how a log in is handled closer. There are certainly ways around my method of handling this, and I'm sure there are either built-in or easily accessible ways to keep a user logged in or verify they are allowed access when using certain parts of the site.

Next - Database: Storing the user data in a database and securely connecting to it from the server side is what I believe to be the desired method of handling user data storage and retrieval. This in combination with handling access will be the focus of the next web project I complete.

Next - Writing: Should flesh out the blog writing part. Also how to have the posts accessible even for non-logged users (not needing to pull it based on the logged in user is the desirable effect).
